# // Weather-Journal App Project //

This is my third project, and I aim to successfully apply the skills I have learned to complete this project's requirements.


## // Overview //

- I developed an asynchronous web application that utilizes a Web API and user input to dynamically update the user interface.
- The code was written using ES6, and I made adjustments to the HTML and CSS files to create a clean and simple layout.
- I included a small tag to display error messages from the API, and I utilized the URL extension "&units=metric" to obtain the temperature in Celsius.
- The code is well-documented with comments for improved readability.


## // How to Use //

1. To use the application, simply enter the ZIP code of the desired city in the United States. You may also optionally enter your feelings.
2. The application will display the following information:

- City name
- Temperature
- Date
- Weather description
- Your feelings
